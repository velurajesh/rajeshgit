This is my first Web Application built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB. 

This application creates a client server behaviour which handles secured login and registration to a user without any password encryption.

The database connects to my mongolab server

The HTML pages are created on the server side using nodeJS. Highly secure application to show the power of MEN - MONGODB, EXPRESS & NODEJS.
